## Why CCHelper

Because my current main job is teaching. :-)

## Usage

Copy `Install.bat`, `Uninstall.bat` and `Release/CCHelper.exe` on a USB dongle (you need to create a Release folder and put `CCHelper.exe` into it), then go through the computers and run `Install.bat`.

Once installed, CCHelper will run automatically at user's login (it doesn't install itself globally, therefore it doesn't require administrative privileges).

## License

CCHelper is licensed under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License version 3.
